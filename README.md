AlgorithmVisualizer

📌 Overview

AlgorithmVisualizer is a web application designed to help users visualize various computer science algorithms. It provides interactive visual representations to enhance understanding and improve learning.

🚀 Features

Turing Machine Simulation - Visualize how a Turing Machine processes inputs.

Pathfinder Algorithm - Demonstrates shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra’s, A*.

Sorting Visualizer - Animations for sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

Recursion Tree - Visual representation of recursion calls.

Convex Hull - Visualization of computational geometry algorithms.

Prime Numbers - Interactive visual approach to prime number generation.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

Backend: (If applicable, mention if Node.js, Express, or any API is used)

State Management: React Hooks
